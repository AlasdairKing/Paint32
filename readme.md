# Paint32

A simple image creation tool for my children to use when they want to make graphics in video games. Free ones are either on Windows (no good on tablets) or filled with adverts.

You have very basic editing tools, and Save will give you a 32px-square PNG with transparency.

Writting in Vanilla JavaScript in VS Code with Live Server. Linted by Stylelint, eslint, HTMLHint. Formatting by Prettier. 

## TODO 

- Visually display the pixels that are transparent, with the grey checkerboard common to graphics programs.
- Make a 50% transparent paintbrush for corners.
- Create default set of icons to give children a place to start.
- Open PNG files from disk.
- Better save operation. Lose naming the file?
